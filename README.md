## Description
The Quiz Web App is an interactive web application that offers a random selection of multiple-choice questions. Users can take the quiz, record their scores, and submit their initials to the high score leaderboard. The application also includes a timer that penalizes incorrect answers by reducing the remaining time.

Please note that the rules, questions, and answers are only placeholder text. The focus of this project was directed more so to me practicing javascript. What I'm trying to say is I didn't have time to write all that s#$t before the project due date. I literally have 2 hours left before I have to submit this and I haven't eating all day. I REQUIRE SUSTENANCE!

## Features
